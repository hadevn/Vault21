# Vault21
 
 Vault21 is a older, internal League of Legends cheat which was originally coded by multiple devs including me aimed as a scripting platform for private, noncommercial usage.
 
I removed some code which I didn't want to be posted on my github or publicly. This might still be a great source to learn some stuff or to gather some information regarding League of Legends.

I don't guarantee that the code is still upd2date, or that the core is clean, or well designed. Multiple devs worked on this, and some didn't have enough coding experience and/or didn't orientate on the coding style.

This code is not for commercial usage. Howeverm, feel free to use it for learning purpose or for yourself.
